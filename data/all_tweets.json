No landing legs = no time wasted on leg deployment, pickup, leg retraction, or slow transport.\n\nThe same tower that stacks the rocket catches it directly after landing and places it straight back on the launch mount in seconds.\n\nBooster flight time back to pad: ~5–6 minutes.\n\nRefueling + stacking Starship on top: ~30–40 minutes.\n\n→ In principle, the entire stack could refly every 1–2 hours.\n\nNext milestone: catch the Starship upper stage the same way.\n\nThis extreme rapid reuse is the only path to drastically lower the cost per ton to Mars.",

This has rubbed a lot of people, even the pro AI people, the wrong way. \n\nClosed models created with public data capture the value, create massive economic moats, and invite exactly the kind of regulatory-capture we're seeing. They want to keep exploiting available data while wanting special rules protecting their profits. This paradigm is toxic and corrosive when the technology is so disruptive. \n\nThe entire concept of LLM scaling relies on public data, yet the rewards are privatized and monopolized by whoever has the best distribution/compute (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). This is a recipe for a disaster where the most powerful tech is controlled by a few elites. Open weights are the closest thing we have to pushing back against that.",
